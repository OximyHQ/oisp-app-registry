notes: |
  Claude Desktop is Anthropic's official desktop client with unique features:
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for tool integrations
  - Local file access and computer use capabilities
  - Project-based conversations with persistent context

  MCP servers run as child processes and may make their own network calls.
  These should be attributed back to Claude Desktop.

  The app communicates directly with claude.ai and api.anthropic.com.
